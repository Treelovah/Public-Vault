 *
 *  <h1>Practical 2: Salary Data</h1>
 *
 *  This object helps read in salary data, for you to process in
 *  the rest of your assignment. While you can see the code to this object,
 *  it is better to treat it similar to how would look at other useful classes
 *  in java such as scanner or math.
 *
 *  The columns in the datafile are defined as follows
 *  <ul>
 *   <li>Major</li>
 *   <li>Male Salary Average</li>
 *   <li>Female Salary Average</li>
 *   <li>White Salary Average</li>
 *   <li>People of Color Average</li>
 *   <li>Overall Salary Average</li>
 *   <li>Percent Male</li>
 *   <li>Percent Female</li>
 *   <li>Percent White</li>
 *   <li>Percent PoC</li>
 *  </ul>
