/*
Mad Libs are activities that have a person provide various words, which are then used to complete a short story in unexpected (and hopefully funny) ways.

Complete the program to read the needed values from input, that the existing output statement(s) can use to output a short story.

Ex: If the input is:

    Eric Chipotle 12 cars

the output is: 

    Eric went to Chipotle to buy 12 different types of cars.
