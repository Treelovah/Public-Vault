First official day researching after learning a bit about the language, i have some ideas.

First note is that the 'steghide' program will need to be called every single time, this in and of itself is the bottleneck of our program. 

~~if we can get someone more experienced in cryptography, we may be able to rewrite this program without the need of steghide, which would drastically increase the performance.. this is a theory.~~

---------------------------------------------------------
START
# call steghide
# set up steghide to receive input from loop
# write a while loop that goes through word list and passes passwords to steghide parameters
# create conditional that pumps errors to /dev/null or print password if correct.
INTERMEDIATE
# create a visual percentage timer that will show how much of the list has been used
# create options for other word lists
# clean up code
ADVANCED
# TBD
