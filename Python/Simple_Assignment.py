# Simple Assignment:

# The basic assignment statement has this form:

<variable> = <expr>

# examples

x = 3.9 * x * (1 - x)
fahrenheit = 9 / 5 * celsius + 32
x = 5

# A variable can be assigned many times. It always retains the value of the most recent assignment
# here is an interactive Python session that demonstrates the point.

>>> myVar = 0
>>> myVar
0
>>> myVar = 7
>>> myVar
7
>>> myVar + 1
>>> myVar
8

# The last assignment statement shows how the current value of a variable can be used to update
# its value. in this case i simply added 1 to the previous value.
# The chaos.py program from chapter 1 did something similar, although a bit more complex.
# Remember that the values of variables can change; that's why they're called variables.
